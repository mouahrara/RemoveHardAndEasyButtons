The Remove Hard and Easy Buttons add-on simplifies the Anki review interface by removing the Hard and Easy response buttons, leaving only Again and Good. This pass/fail-style workflow helps address well-known limitations of the legacy SM-2 algorithm and reduces cognitive load by allowing you to focus on recall instead of subjective difficulty ratings.
